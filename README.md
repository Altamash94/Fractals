Description
This project is a C++ application that generates fractal images using advanced mathematical transformations and zoom operations. It leverages object-oriented programming (OOP) and efficient algorithms to create intricate fractals with high precision.

Key Features

    •	Fractal Generation – Generates complex fractal images using mathematical transformations.
    •	Zoom Functionality – Enables users to zoom into specific regions to explore fractal details.
    •	Bitmap Handling – Implements a custom Bitmap class to create and manipulate images.
    •	Matrix Operations – Supports matrix multiplication, inversion, and transformations.
    •	Error Handling – Robust error management to ensure stability and prevent crashes.
    •	File Output – Saves fractal images as bitmap files for easy viewing and sharing.

Technical Details

    •	Language: C++
    •	Libraries: Standard C++ libraries, custom Bitmap and Matrix classes
    •	Development Environment: Visual Studio Code
    •	Platform: Windows

Code Highlights
